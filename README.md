Moodle

Problem Statement :

The purpose of our moodle application is to make a make easy portal where college academics work.
 
Objectives: 
•It helps in the smooth hosting of courses. Faculties can post assignments and students can evaluate the same and the same can be graded  as well.

•The Moodle application will have three modes of login: student login, administrator login, and staff login. The administrator has the most authority.

•Whenever a new event or notification is posted students are automatically notified of it by an Email/SMS.

•It also informs the staff and gives them a list of students with high marks and those below standard attendance on a single button click.

•It also includes a student grievances area where students may post college inconsistencies and other problems. These posts will only be visible to the administrator.

•Only staff, administrator have the permission to post events. Students can view those notifications and react accordingly.

•The Moodle should have provision for adding courses, faculties, and students.

•Discussion forum for discussing on topics pertaining to course should also be present.

These are the basic details of the files in the source code.
Although, the software is very user friendly, this are the guidelines which will be useful to use the software.

If you are a student, you will have to get registered by the administrator for the courses you want to enroll for. After signing in, you will be redirected to your dashboard, where you will get to see all the courses, you have enrolled for. Further more, for the assignment and project submission, you have to further go into each course.
