worst case - upper bound of program(max no of operations)
e.g. like in linear search element is not present in array

average case - For the linear search problem,
 let us assume that all cases are uniformly distributed
 (including the case of x not being present in array).
 So we sum all the cases and divide the sum by (n+1).
 Following is the value of average case time complexity.

best case - lower bound of program(min no of operations)
The number of operations in the best case is constant (not dependent on n)
So time complexity in the best case would be T(1)
